                We know a lot about the continent of America, after all it is the geographic location of the worlds current super power but more than military might the continent and especially the country for which it is named and that gives it is bearings on the map weaves a cultural spell over the whole globe. It is the home of Hollywood which sets clearly the bounds of the entire world within the 54 States of the American Union with everything else as periphery to that centre. The old world London to Beijing are reference points to the behemoth that is New York or even California. It is also the home of hip hop and break dance and a plethora of other cultural out put not to mention the place where fast food was invented. It is also the home of silicon valley and the home of nerdy clever types who come up with elaborate means - with ready venture capital to back it - to get the fast food delivered even faster - and by the click of a button no less - so that the hungry the world over only have to leave their lazy boy to receive a brown manila bag with golden arches or emblazoned with the likeness of a Kentuckian cornel famous for inventing a fried chicken recipe. <br>

                However the mythos associated with America has not always been as captivating as it is now. Christopher Columbus is famous for heading bravely and somewhat counter intuitively away from India hoping that since the world was round he would eventually surprise the Indians from the back. Theoretically he was right but geographically he stumbled upon America which he assumed for a long time was India, hence the Caribbean islands are to date refers to the as the West Indies perhaps in homage to this great confusion. <br>

                This however is not a website about geography or colonialism or even the military industrial complex. This is a website about food. The history of food and how our most popular delicacies like chips, vanilla ice cream and even chilly peppers made it on to our plates in the first place. <br>
                <br>
                A New World of Food is a site where we will trace the food from the Americas - both North America and South America and its current place in our daily diet. We will investigate how food just like people migrates, how diets and tastes change and what that means for the cultures and identities we derive from food and there for take as a give. We will look at the wonders of: artichokes, avocados, beans (kidney and lima), black walnuts, blueberries, cacao (cocoa/chocolate), cashews, cassava, chestnuts, corn (maize), crab apples, cranberries, gourds, hickory nuts, onions, papayas, peanuts, pecans, peppers (bell peppers, chilli peppers), pineapples, plums, potatoes, pumpkins, raspberries, squash, strawberries, sunflowers, sweet potatoes, tobacco, tomatoes, turkey, vanilla, wild cherries, wild riceâ€¦ not to mention but a few. <br>
